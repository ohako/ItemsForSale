This is ItemsForSale, v0.1

This program generates random items for sale, using the tables from the Core Rulebook and Ultimate Equipment.

ant build to build an ItemsForSale.jar

java -jar ItemsForSale.jar <number of items> <item degree> <economy modifier>

number of items, should be expressed in 'dice', like '3d4' or '1d6'. You can also modify this value, like '3d4+2', etc.

item degree is minor/medium/major

economy modifier...so, Ultimate Equipment introduced the idea of a 'qualifier', which is least/lesser/greater. least only applies to minor
slotless wondrous items, anyway! A given town stat block only names the item degree, not the qualifier. I decided to make the choice of 
qualifier for a given item random (50/50 lesser/greater)...modified by the 'economy' stat of a given town. That is, the better the 
economy of a given town, the better chance of seeing nicer items for sale! This input is optional

TODO: make a bunch of 'presets' of towns whose default stat blocks are known, like 'Sandpoint'.

Anyway, there's a pile more to do, the big things being

a) total code redesign, because the code is pretty bad at this point
b) get more errata! There is some errata in here already

1. pricing for the amulet of mighty fists is fixed
2. the random weapon table is correctly patched

and c) fix how weapon and armor special abilities are assigned, to avoid illegal combinations (like an anchoring repositiong 
weapon, for instance
